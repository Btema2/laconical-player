## Vibe-Coding with Antigravity

This project is built using a "vibe-coding" approach. While I value deep technical knowledge, I also lean heavily on **Google Antigravity** and **Google Gemini** for architecting and implementing many of the complex systems. I focus on the vibe, the user experience, the aesthetics, and the overall feel of the app, and let the AI help with the heavy lifting of the Android SDK.
